# Record and Replay Legit Payload

## record_legit_payload.sh

`record_legit_payload.sh` starts both ss-server and ss-local; and records the connection payload sent by ss-local.

The payload is recorded to the `first_legit_payload.log`.

It will also keep all the log and pcap files in a directory like `log_${epochtime}`.

## replay_prober.py

`replay_prober.py` replays the connections recorded in `first_legit_payload.log`; and logs server reactions.
