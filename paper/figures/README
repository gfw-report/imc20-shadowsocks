Makefile contains rules for generating figures. Run
	make

The code requires Python 3, NumPy, and Pandas.

The input data for the figures is derived ultimately from pcap files,
which are gigabytes in size and not versioned in this repository. In
this repository there are filtered and reduced CSV files containing only
what is necessary for the figures, and additionally filtered to redact
the IP addresses of experimental hosts. There are rules in Makefile to
recreate these minimized CSV files from complete CSV files, which in
turn were generated from Jupyter notebooks with access to the source
pcap files. If you put the complete CSV files in the proper place (see
Makefile rules), then `make` will also rebuild these minimized CSV
files.

In the cdf_ip_occurrences subdirectory, excluded_ip_list.txt is a list
of IP addresses to exclude, a file copied from the original Jupyter
source directory. exclude_additional.txt contains IP addresses to
exclude that were hardcoded in the original Jupyter processing script.
