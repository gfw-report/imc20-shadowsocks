    Abstract = {Research on Internet censorship is hampered by poor models of censor behavior. Censor models guide the development of circumvention systems, so it is important to get them right. A censor model should be understood not just as a set of capabilities---such as the ability to monitor network traffic---but as a set of priorities constrained by resource limitations.

My research addresses the twin themes of modeling and circumvention. With a grounding in empirical research, I build up an abstract model of the circumvention problem and examine how to adapt it to concrete censorship challenges. I describe the results of experiments on censors that probe their strengths and weaknesses; specifically, on the subject of active probing to discover proxy servers, and on delays in their reaction to changes in circumvention. I present two circumvention designs: domain fronting, which derives its resistance to blocking from the censor's reluctance to block other useful services; and Snowflake, based on quickly changing peer-to-peer proxy servers. I hope to change the perception that the circumvention problem is a cat-and-mouse game that affords only incremental and temporary advancements. Rather, let us state the assumptions about censor behavior atop which we build circumvention designs, and let those assumptions be based on an informed understanding of censor behavior.}

  abstract = {People are accustomed to using an anonymous network to protect their private information. The Profile HMM (Hidden Markov Model) Website Fingerprinting Detection algorithm can detect the website that the data stream accesses by pattern matching the captured data traffic. This makes the anonymous network lose its effect. In order to bypass the detection of this model, we propose a method based on genetic algorithm to generate adversarial samples. By migrating the problem of adversarial samples in deep learning, our approach is used for the broader machine learning detection model to do traffic confusion, and then achieves the purpose of bypassing the Profile HMM model detection. The key challenge is how to construct a suitable fitness function to generate an effective adversarial sample at minimal cost. The experimental results show that the success rate of our traffic confusion method is as high as 97\%. At the same time, we only need to add less perturbation traffic than the traditional traffic confusion method.}
